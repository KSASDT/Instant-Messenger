# Instant-Messenger

--------------------Instant Messenger--------------------------------


Created Instant messaging program with sockets and streams using java programming language. Write code for 
two programs one sits on first communicating entity (computer) and other sits on second. Run the 'server.java' on 
your computer. In this 'server.java' first build GUI(Graphics User Interface) for Instant messenger. After
that set up the server and wait for a connection. After connected to someone we need to set up the streams
or pathways from/to other computer by using setUpStream() method. Then get stream to send and receieve the 
data. After that start doing conversation. Once you done chatting you need to closed down the streams and 
sockets. Meanwhile we code for how to send the messeges and display the messages in the chat window, Giving 
the user permission to type. Made new class 'ServerTest.java' that used for testing server side portion of 
application. Run the complete program then you get the pop up window of messenger displying 'waiting for someone 
to connect'and we are not able to type the message. So we need to build another program having class 'Client.java'
that very similar to previous one but instead of server this program is sits on client side. Once we set up this
program then we gonna have connection, client and start talking to one another.
